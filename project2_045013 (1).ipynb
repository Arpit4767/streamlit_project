    "**Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this code is to perform an in-depth analysis of a movies dataset using Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly. It seeks to uncover patterns related to movie budgets, scores, and genres, providing interactive tools for users to explore the data dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset, loaded from a CSV file, comprises various attributes, including movie names, genres, budgets, scores, and release years.\n",
    "Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) using movies_data.info() reveals the structure and datatypes of the dataset.\n",
    "Average Budgets per Genre:\n",
    "\n",
    "Average budgets for each genre are calculated using the groupby function on the 'genre' column, and the results are rounded for clarity.\n",
    "The average budget per genre is then displayed in a static matplotlib plot (fig) with genres on the x-axis and average budgets on the y-axis.\n",
    "This visual representation provides a quick overview of the financial investment associated with different genres.\n",
    "User Interaction via Sidebar:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Streamlit sidebar is introduced to enhance user interaction.\n",
    "Users can filter movies based on their score using a slider (new_score_rating) and choose specific genres and release years.\n",
    "Movies Filtered by Genre and Year:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two columns (col1 and col2) in the main section of the Streamlit app are dedicated to presenting specific information based on user choices.\n",
    "In col1, a list of movies is displayed, filtered by the selected genre and release year. The resulting DataFrame (dataframe_genre_year) includes columns for movie names, genres, and release years.\n",
    "This section allows users to quickly identify and explore movies within their preferred genre and release year.\n",
    "User Score Distribution Across Genres:\n",
    "\n",
    "In col2, a dynamic Plotly chart (figpx) is generated to showcase the distribution of user scores across different genres.\n",
    "The chart is interactive, allowing users to zoom in and out, providing a more granular view of how scores are distributed within each genre.\n",
    "The x-axis represents genres, and the y-axis represents the count of movies falling within the selected score range.\n",
    "Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Budget Insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial static matplotlib plot shows the average budgets for each genre. Genres like 'Fantasy' and 'Adventure' tend to have higher average budgets, indicating that these genres might require significant financial investments in production.\n",
    "User Interaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction of the sidebar and interactive elements allows users to customize their exploration of the dataset. This is crucial for researchers, analysts, and industry professionals looking for specific insights.\n",
    "Filtered Movie Lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of movies displayed in col1 provides a detailed overview of movies within the chosen genre and year. This can assist in identifying trends and patterns specific to certain time periods or genres.\n",
    "User Score Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic Plotly chart in col2 dynamically illustrates how user scores are distributed across genres. Users can adjust the score range using the sidebar slider, gaining insights into audience preferences for movies with specific score ranges.\n",
    "Managerial Implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Budget Allocation Strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Managers can utilize the average budget per genre insights to formulate strategies for budget allocation. This aids in making informed decisions on resource distribution and financial planning for upcoming projects.\n",
    "User Engagement Strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "The user interaction features of the Streamlit app provide a valuable tool for market research. Industry professionals can use this to tailor their content based on user preferences in terms of scores, genres, and release years.\n",
    "Content Planning:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic Plotly chart is particularly useful for content planning. It allows content creators to understand the distribution of user scores within genres, assisting in the creation of content that aligns with audience expectations.\n",
    "Audience Trends:\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive nature of the Streamlit app facilitates the identification of audience trends. For instance, if there is a surge in the popularity of certain genres within specific score ranges, content creators can capitalize on these trends.\n",
    "Decision Support System:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this Streamlit app can function as a decision support system, aiding managers and content creators in making data-driven decisions. The ability to interact with the data in real-time enhances the decision-making process.\n",
    "In conclusion, this code and Streamlit app provide a powerful platform for analyzing and visualizing movies data. The integration of user interaction features makes it a versatile tool for both exploratory data analysis and strategic decision-making in the entertainment industry. Managers and content creators can leverage the insights gained from this analysis to optimize resource utilization and better cater to audience preferences."
